Problem 1
=========

Create Dataframe
----------------

I am creating a dataframe with 4 vectors. One vector is a random sample of size 10 from the uniform distribution. I will make a logical vector indicating which elements are greater than 2. I will also create a factor vector and a character vector.

``` r
first_problem_df = tibble(
  uniform_sample_vector = runif(10, 0, 5),
  greater_than_two = uniform_sample_vector > 2,
  factor_vector = as.factor(c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b")),
  character_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j")
)
```

Mean of Vectors
---------------

When I take the mean of these vectors, I get a number back for the logical and numeric vectors, but I get a warning that NAs are being returned for the factor and character vectors. This is because mean() treats the logical vector as numeric, giving TRUE a value of 1 and FALSE a value of 0, but it does not do this with character or factor vectors.

``` r
mean(first_problem_df$uniform_sample_vector)
```

    ## [1] 2.477036

``` r
mean(first_problem_df$greater_than_two)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(first_problem_df$factor_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(first_problem_df$factor_vector): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(first_problem_df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(first_problem_df$character_vector): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Converting to Numeric
---------------------

When I apply as.numeric to the logical vector, I get a vector of 1s and 0s returned When I apply as.numeric to the factor vector, I get a vector of 1 and 2, each number corresponding to a level. I get NAs when I apply as.numeric to a character vector.

``` r
as.numeric(first_problem_df$greater_than_two)
as.numeric(first_problem_df$factor_vector)
as.numeric(first_problem_df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

When I convert my character vector to a factor and then to numeric I get a numeric vector 1:10 because the character vector had 10 unique entries, so there were 10 levels and each number corresponds to a level. When I convert my factor vector to a character vector to a numeric vector I get NAs because character vectors cannot be converted to numeric vectors

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(first_problem_df$character_vector))
```

    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(first_problem_df$factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

Problem 2
=========

Create Data Frame
-----------------

``` r
set.seed(1)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  x_plus_y_larger_zero = (x + y) > 0,
  x_plus_y_larger_zero_numeric = as.numeric(x_plus_y_larger_zero),
  x_plus_y_larger_zero_factor = as.factor(x_plus_y_larger_zero)
)
```

There are 5 columns and 1000 rows.
The mean of x is -0.0116481 and the median of x is -0.0353242
The proportion of cases for which x\_plus\_y\_larger\_zero is TRUE is 0.49

Scatter Plots
-------------

I get the same plots when I color by a factor and by a logical vector. When I color by a numerical vector the legend shows a gradient of color going from 0 to 1 because the numbers in the vectors range from 0 to 1 since FALSE gets 0 and TRUE gets 1. Additionally, the numeric vector plot colors are different than the colors for logical and factor. For all of these plots, the coordinates where (x+y)&gt;2 are one color and those for which (x+y)&lt;= 2 are another color.

``` r
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = x_plus_y_larger_zero)) + labs(title = "Colored by Logical Vector") + geom_point()
```
