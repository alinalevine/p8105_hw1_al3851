# Problem 1


I am creating a random sample of size 10 from the uniform distribution and will make 
a logical vector indicating which elements are greater than 2

```{r random uniform sample}

uniform_sample_vector = runif(10, 0, 5)

greater_than_two = uniform_sample_vector > 2

```

I am creating a numerical vector and a character vector of size 10

```{r}
numeric_vector = 1:10

character_vector = rep("a", 10)

```

When I take the mean of these vectors, I get a number back for the 
logical and numeric vctors, but not the character vector. This is because
mean() treats the logical vector as numeric, giving TRUE a value of 1
and FALSE a value of 0, but it does not do this with character vectors

```{r}
mean(uniform_sample_vector)
mean(greater_than_two)
mean(numeric_vector)
mean(character_vector)

```
